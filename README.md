## Built With

React, React Router, Vite, ChakraUI, Axios

## Lessons Learned

My first full stack project! I learned the ins and outs of how to set up a RESTful API and hook it up to a client-side application. I learned how to properly set up my endpoints and dealing with transferring data back and forth with a client-server system. I also learned ChakraUI with this project and it was a lot of fun!
